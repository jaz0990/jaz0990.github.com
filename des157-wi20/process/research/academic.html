        <h2>The Research of Food Insecurity and Its Ties with Sustainability</h2>
        <article>
            <p>With the rise in population and talk about the issues of sustainability in farming, the future of farming is a topic that many are speculating about. Our ideas to combat this huge issue range from using GMO, consuming insects, or even creating plantation farms on Mars. Now, Mars is probably a very far-fetched idea at this point, but little do we realise that starting on the micro-scale can be an efficient approach.</p>
            <p>On a small plot of land, a man named Ron Finley started a movement of growing crops in his front lawn. Finley lived in South Central, a district in LA that’s notorious for food insecurity and unhealthy eating habits. Finley’s idea of gardening went into action, and he was growing more than what he could handle. His neighbors saw the transformation of his yard, and were interested in Finley’s ideas. Soon enough, the entire community shared a common goal of fighting food insecurity, and started to grow gardens of their own. Finley’s garden brought together friendships, respect, and a circle of giving. </p>
            <p>Food insecurity and sustainability are closely related subjects, and for those who aren’t able to afford much often resort to consuming processed foods. Processed foods are often packaged in materials made from plastics, and aren’t healthy for the environment. In the case of Lauren Singer, her way of avoiding these anti-sustainable packaging products is to live a zero-waste life. Singer realized that plastic was everywhere. It covered all packaged food items she was buying in the grocery store, and she didn’t seem to know how to combat this issue. Singer realised that by bringing her own reusable bag to the grocery store, and picking whole fruits and vegetables, she wouldn’t have to purchase the wasteful pre-packaged salads (Singer, 2015). By making this change in lifestyle, she found that she was living a healthier lifestyle since she wasn’t purchasing processed foods. She also created less waste, and found that it’s not as hard as a lifestyle people may believe it to be.</p>
            <p>Young people are the prime audience to educate and spread awareness of the needs to live a sustainable lifestyle. With the current digital trends, it is important to format this type of education into a style that is modernly appreciated. Websites, illustrations, motion, and sounds are great visual scopes that prompt the learner to retain information. If the educational path is visually pleasing and fun, it will be easy for children to learn and understand the appropriate steps to live sustainably. 
            </p>
            <p>The main objective of this project is to educate and impose the steps of fighting food insecurity within households. This approach will be formatted into an illustrated, interactive website that utilizes a storytelling approach to showcase the value of gardening. The website will have a simple scroll feature function, with a layout combining illustrations, text, and color into an educational experience that actively engages with visual senses. The project will present benefits that extend beyond gardening, which have been proven in research studies. In 2009 a participatory study that focused on 42 families enrolled in gardening with participants aging in a range from 21 to 78 years old (Carney, 2012). It was found that community gardening boosted the affordability of food products, cultivated community relationships, and promoted vegetable consumption by 40% (Carney, 2012).</p>
            <p>By formatting this research into a visually-entertaining website, it will effectively impose the idea to users that gardening isn’t an elderly exercise, but can be a thrilling, interactive activity that ties communities together to a shared commonality of respect and healthy living habits. Also, who doesn’t like free food?</p>
