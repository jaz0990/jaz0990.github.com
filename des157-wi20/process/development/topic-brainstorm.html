            <h2>Affinity Mapping</h2>
            <p>Relating to the main theme of bulding inclusiveness, respect, and reciprocity, I've developed an affinity map to develop my thought process. </p>
            <p>I started off with the idea of online etiquitte. In this digital age, a lot of problems have arisen on the internet. There are numerous problems with trolls on social media like on Instagram and Youtube. Oftentimes it is hard to imagine that people will really take these comments seriously, but the truth is that bad comments hurt. </p>
            <p>In the coming generations, people should be taught respect online. There are different rules than in person, especially since it is harder to see how a person really thinks and feels. Emojis at least help with that a bit. Online etiquitte includes the elimination of hate, building meaningful online relationships, and it can even extend to how designers build websites and think about the user. The improvement of positivity in the user's experience of the internet are all included in online etiquitte.</p>
            <p> Below is my thought process of building this affinity map.</p>
