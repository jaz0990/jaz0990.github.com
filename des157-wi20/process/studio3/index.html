    <h1>Game of Twig</h1>
    <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is presses the button. The total is added to the current player's score, unless they both get a twig. If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each roll, the current player can either roll again, or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</p> 
    <p>Oh, and if you roll two dead tree twigs (snake eyes), your current score gets zeroed out. So don’t do that.</p>
